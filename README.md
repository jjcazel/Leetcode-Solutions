# LeetCode Solutions 💻

Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions! This repository serves as my record on the road to mastering data structures and algorithms 🚀.

## Approach 🛠️

Adopting the Grind 75 strategy, I'm methodically working through a curated list of essential problems that cover a broad spectrum of topics, all critical for software engineering interviews and personal growth. Each solution is more than just code—it's a piece of the puzzle in understanding the depth and breadth of algorithmic thinking.

## Highlights ✨

- **Systematic Learning**: Emphasizing a step-by-step mastery of concepts.
- **Diverse Problems**: From easy to hard, covering arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Best Practices**: Following coding standards and optimizing for efficiency and readability.

## Goals 🎯

My journey through LeetCode is about more than just preparing for interviews; it's about deepening my problem-solving skills, enhancing my algorithmic thinking, and contributing to a community of learners. I have solved many more problems than what is recorded here on the platform itself. Here is [my profile](https://leetcode.com/jjcazel/).
